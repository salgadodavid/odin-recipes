# odin-recipes
A toy HTML website showcasing Recipes with my personal spice mix.

This is the first project in The Odin Project using basic HTML.
The goal of this project was to create a main page listing 3 recipes that has links to the pages of the individual recipes.  

In this project I put in practice my basic Html skills such as:
Linkin images.
Linking pages.
Creating ordered and unordered lists.
